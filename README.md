# windows-server-projects
A hands-on portfolio of Windows Server 2022 infrastructure labs including AD, DNS, DHCP, GPO, and Print Server.
Key activities included:
Installing and configuring Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to manage users and groups.
Setting up DNS and DHCP for name resolution and automatic IP address allocation.
Configuring a Print Server to handle network print services.
Creating an Organizational Unit (OU) and assigning role-based access for IT Engineers.
Designing and implementing Group Policies (GPOs) such as password complexity rules and restricting access to the Control Panel.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in server installation, domain management, and security best practices, while reinforcing my knowledge of enterprise IT infrastructure.
